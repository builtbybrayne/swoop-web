Append-only capture for ad-hoc ideas, questions, and nudges that don't have a long-term home yet. Triage periodically into: planning docs (`planning/`), commercials (archive), or deletion.

## 2026-04-22 — Scraping vs API trade-off: URL generation for in-page deep links

If we scrape the website, we get real page URLs for each product / region / story as a side-benefit. The chat agent could then offer "go see this page" links that drop the visitor directly onto the relevant Swoop page.

Implication: if the visitor clicks through, the chat disappears (new page load). For that to be useful, the chat needs to survive navigation — stateful, picks up where it left off on the next page. Cross-page chat persistence has UX and technical implications (localStorage session id + rehydrate on mount; or iframe host-page coordination; or deferred until the user returns to a "home" surface).

Alternative: if we get data via API (Friday hackathon), we may still be able to reconstruct URLs given known type + id patterns — worth confirming in the hackathon.

Where this lands: Puma's chat-surface implementation plan (Tier 2 chunk D) needs to either commit to cross-page persistence or explicitly defer it. Handle in Tier 2 when chunk D is planned.
